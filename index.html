    <h1>The Development of Cancer Treatment with T-VEC</h1>
    
    <h2>The Definition of Cancer</h2>
    <p>Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. It can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply through a process called cell division to form new cells as the body needs them.</p>
    
    <h2>How Does Cancer Develop?</h2>
    <p>When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.</p>

    <h2>Types of Cancer</h2>
    <p>There are various types of cancer, usually named for the organs or tissues where the cancers form. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and brain cancer starts in the brain. Cancers also may be described by the type of cell that formed them.</p>
    <img src="https://www.cusabio.com/statics/images/cancer-type.jpg" alt="Types of Cancer">
    
    <p>The tumor name are based on the type of cell in which they formed and where the tumor first formed in the central nervous system. For example, an astrocytic tumor begins in star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes, which help keep nerve cells healthy. Brain tumors can be benign (not ca) the brain. </p>
    <p>Cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and can travel to distant places in the body to form new tumors (a process called metastasis). Cancerous tumors may also be called malignant tumors. Many cancers form solid tumors, but cancers of the blood, such as leukaemia,, generally do not.</p>

    <p>Benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. When removed, benign tumors usually don’t grow back, whereas cancerous tumors sometimes do. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large, however. Some can cause serious symptoms or be life threatening, such as bengin tumour i brain</p>
    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>There are basically 7 types of treatment for cancer.</p>
    <img src="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328915358/figure/fig2/AS:692558619504642@1542130250212/Timeline-of-epochal-turning-points-in-modern-oncology-After-the-development-of.png" alt="Cancer Treatment Timeline">
    <h2>New Research: T-VEC Treatment</h2>
    <p>According to new research, new technology has been found for the treatment of cancer with the help of viruses. Scientists have developed a drug made from a genetically modified form of herpes simplex, the cold sore virus, to attack tumors in cancer patients' bodies, developing a cutting-edge form of cancer therapy in the process.</p>
    <p><b><u>Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC)</u></b> is the first oncolytic viral immunotherapy to be approved for the local treatment of unresectable metastatic stage IIIB/C–IVM1a melanoma. Its direct intratumoral injection aims to trigger local and systemic immunologic responses leading to tumor cell lysis, followed by the release of tumor-derived antigens and subsequent activation of tumor-specific effector T-cells. Its approval has fueled interest in studying its possible synergy with other immunotherapeutics in preclinical models as well as in clinical contexts. In fact, it has been shown that intratumoral administration of this immunostimulatory agent successfully synergizes with immune checkpoint inhibitors.The objectives of this review are to resume the current state of the art of T-VEC treatment when used in monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, describing the strong rationale of its development, the adverse events of interest and the clinical outcome in selected patient’s populations.</p>
    
    <h3>T-VEC Mechanisms of Action and Preclinical Activity</h3>
    <p>Oncolytic viruses include wild-type and modified live viruses and represent an innovative approach to cancer immunotherapy. In particular, T-VEC is a first-in-class oncolytic virus, intra-lesionally delivered, constituted by a genetically engineered herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) that selectively replicates in tumor tissue, lyses tumor cells, while promoting anti-tumor immunity.Moreover, human GM-CSF gene is inserted in the virus and this results in local GM-CSF production, able to enhance the influx and activation of dendritic cells (DCs) needed to start a systemic antitumor response. Finally, the genes encoding neurovirulence factor ICP34.5 and ICP47 are functionally deleted in the viral drug Functional deletion of ICP34.5 attenuates viral pathogenicity and allows the virus to replicate selectively in tumors, while deletion of the ICP47 gene reduces virally mediated suppression of antigen presentation and increase the expression of the HSV US11 gene, which in turn, promotes virus growth in tumor cells without impairing tumor selectivity.</p>

    <p>In, general, cancer immunotherapy relies on the recognition of tumor-associated antigens by immune cells and involve innate immunity components, as well as proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor α and interferon-γ. When T-VEC immunotherapy is given intratumorally, it causes direct tumoral cells to die and acts as a source of antigens, favoring local recruitment of immune cells into the tumor microenvironment. Subsequently primed T cells induce a systemic polyclonal antitumor response, which can potentially address intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity in particular, T-VEC, entering the cancer cells through the herpes virus glycoproteins on the cell surface, favorably replicates and ultimately triggers cell lysis. In this way, tumor-derived antigens (TDA), GM-CSF and new viral particles are released allowing just one-time infection of surrounding tumoral cells and enhancing TDA spreading. In addition, danger-associated molecular pathways are activated, evoking a systemic antitumor effect and a complete immune response to occur.</p>
    <p>Practically, T-VEC is administered through a series of intralesional injections and bypasses absorption barriers, so traditional pharmacokinetic studies were not relevant and therefore not performed. On mouse models, the highest concentration of viral DNA is detectable in the site of injection. However, viral DNA was also found at lower concentrations in non-target sites, like blood, spleen, lymph node, liver, heart and kidney, while it was absent in the bone marrow, eyes, lachrymal glands, nasal mucosa and feces. The attenuated virus is eliminated via host-defense mechanisms, including autophagy and adaptive immune responses, but viral DNA may persist in neuronal cell bodies surrounding the site of injection without clinical implications.</p>

            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li>	Targeted Action: T-VEC is designed to specifically target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells relatively unharmed. It replicates within cancer cells, causing them to rupture and die.</li>
                    <li>	Immunotherapy: T-VEC stimulates the body's immune response against cancer. By infecting tumor cells, it induces an immune response against the virus-infected cells, which can also target non-infected cancer cells.</li>
                    <li>	Localized Treatment: It's administered directly into the tumor site, which means it primarily acts on the injected tumor and may have less systemic side effects compared to other cancer treatments.</li>
                    <li>	Potential for Durable Response: Some studies suggest that T-VEC treatment can lead to long-lasting responses in some patients, even after treatment has stopped.</li>
                    <li>  Combination Therapy: T-VEC can be used in combination with other cancer treatments like immune checkpoint inhibitors to potentially enhance their effectiveness.</li>

                    <li>	Localized Treatment Limitation: T-VEC's localized administration means it may not effectively target metastatic cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body.</li>
                    <li>	Side Effects: Like all cancer treatments, T-VEC can cause side effects, including flu-like symptoms, fatigue, injection site reactions, and in some cases, more severe complications such as cellulitis or systemic infections.</li>
                    <li>	Resistance: Some tumors may develop resistance to T-VEC over time, limiting its long-term effectiveness in those cases.</li>
                    <li>	Cost: As with many novel cancer treatments, the cost of T-VEC therapy may be high, potentially limiting access for some patients or healthcare systems.</li>

    <div class="clinical-trials">
        <h3>Clinical Trials</h3>
        <p>T-VEC had been firstly tested in a Phase I study, where it demonstrated biological activity in terms of active viral replication, local reactions (erythema and inflammation of the injected lesions), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expression, tumor necrosis, and apoptosis, as evaluated in post-treatment biopsies.</p>
        <p>In Phase II, shrinking in the tumor burden of injected and non-injected lesions, included visceral lesions, was reported, with most of the responses (92%) maintained for almost 3 years.</p>
        <p>However, the Phase III trial was hardly criticized because of the choice of a comparison arm which was not considered the correct standard of treatment, even though it was clearly designed in a period when new drugs and combinations were not approved yet.</p>

    <h3>How often do you have T-VEC?</h3>
    <p>After the first injection of T-VEC, you go back 3 weeks later for the second. You then have injections every 2 weeks. You have T-VEC for at least 6 months. Your doctor may stop T-VEC if it’s no longer helping you or the side effects are too bad.</p>

        <h3> Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The landscape of options for advanced melanoma is rapidly improving and progressing, with drugs and combinations able to significantly expand patients’ window of expectations. However, adverse events occurring during treatment can limit the dose intensity and duration of those treatments, thus consequently affecting their effectiveness.</p>
        <p>T-VEC is the first genetically modified herpes simplex virus-1-based oncolytic immunotherapy approved by FDA and EMA for the treatment of unresectable, cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma recurrent after initial surgery.</p>
        <p>The positive effect of T-VEC, as a monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, which was observed in both injected and uninfected (including visceral) melanoma lesions, indicated that a systemic antitumor immune response was triggered.</p>
        <p>Trials are ongoing to confirm clinical results on a larger number of patients and in comparison, with the best standards of care, in order to confirm this approach is able to achieve high efficacy with low toxicity. Furthermore, new generation clinical trials incorporate regular sampling of both peripheral blood and tumor tissue, allowing basic and translational research, which will give insight into the mechanisms regulating tumor versus T-cells balance in the microenvironment and will characterize the immune response exploring its correlations with clinical outcomes.</p>
